## Why use a S3 Bucket
We need Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality for the S3 Bucket.

The reason for creating and using a S3 bucket:
 - Highly Available
 - Available Globally
 - Cost effective data storage
    - S3 Standard - Offers high durability, availablilty and performance object storage for frequently accessed data. Low latency and high throughput means its appropriate for a variety of use cases such as cloud applications, dynamic websites and  gaming applications
    - S3 Glacier - An extremely low-cost storage service which provides secure, durable and flexible storage for data backup and archival main uses for the S3 Glacier is to offload data which is not accessed often, enabling customers to focus elsewhere rather than the maintaining their storage.
 - Flexibility
    - You are able to store every type of file 
 - Data Persistancy
